**Netflix Movie Data Analysis Project**

This project is an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing 9,000 Netflix movies. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about Netflixâ€™s movie catalog, such as trends in genres, runtimes, release years, viewer ratings, and regional availability. It also aims to explore viewer preferences and identify the key factors that contribute to the success of movies on the platform.

By analyzing this dataset, we aim to better understand Netflix's content strategy and provide actionable insights for entertainment enthusiasts, data analysts, and professionals working in the streaming industry.




**Project Objectives :-** 

**Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   Clean and preprocess the Netflix movie dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain an overview of the data.


**Key Analyses:**
Content Trends:
Identify the most popular genres.


Viewer Preferences:

Study viewer ratings and popularity metrics to determine factors influencing movie success.
Examine patterns in the top-rated or most-watched movies.

Regional Insights:
Explore the availability and popularity of movies across different regions.

Recommendation System (Optional):
Build a basic recommendation system to suggest movies based on genres or user preferences.

Visualization:

  Use visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines to present insights in an engaging and clear way.
         Predictive Analysis (Optional):
Use machine learning techniques to predict movie ratings or classify movies into categories based on their features.
